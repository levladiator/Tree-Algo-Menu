This file contains a Tree-Algo Menu implemented in C++ (along with documentation) that supports the following operations:
1. Transforming a weighted graph into a Partial Tree of Minimum Cost in O(N*log2(N)).
2. Distance between 2 given nodes in O(log2(N)).
3. LCA of 2 given nodes in O(log2(N)).
4. The Diameter of the tree in O(N).
5. The Centroid of the tree in O(log2(N)).
6. Number of simple paths that contain a given node (already precalculated for each node in 1.).
7. Linearization of the tree and operations using the Euler Tour of the tree.
8. The option to input another graph/tree.
